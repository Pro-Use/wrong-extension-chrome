Anyone wishing to understand the place of these figures in history is forced to search for their own information online. However, it has become increasingly clear over the last few years that the act of \u2018doing your own research\u2019 is highly susceptible to misinformation and propaganda, and that following even one wrong source can lead to a rabbit hole of information, which only corroborates itself.\n\nThe Hidden Histories project aims to take the uncertainty out of this, by doing your own research for you.\n\nBio:\nNahab is a visual artist and researcher exploring the relationships between\ntechnologies and contemporary knowledge making through the methodology of infrastructural performance.\nBeginning from a post-factual position which regards mythology, conspiracy and esotericism as technologies in their own right, Nahab seeks to understand the ways in which they can be used to do work in the world when they are freed from the truth\/lie dichotomy. Not simply content to pose the question, Nahab takes a more confrontational stance, which is at its heart, concerned with developing practical tools to get things done.\nNahab has been exhibited at the National Gallery and Sotheby\u2019s, and currently has work\nawaiting publication with Routledge examining the intersection of afro-futurism and genre horror.\nThey hold a masters degree in Digital Culture from Goldsmiths University, and are currently\nworking towards an MFA in Computational Arts, also at Goldsmiths.\n\nWebsite: ADeadChannel.com","id":"aHR0cHM6Ly9wYXJhLW5ldC5zcGFjZS9zcGFjZXMvaGlkZGVuLWhpc3Rvcmllcy8=","url":"https:\/\/para-net.space\/spaces\/hidden-histories\/","info_url":"http:\/\/0.0.0.0\/wrong\/invites\/para-net?id=aHR0cHM6Ly9wYXJhLW5ldC5zcGFjZS9zcGFjZXMvaGlkZGVuLWhpc3Rvcmllcy8=","fullscreen":"false","width":"600","height":"600","position":"top-left"},{"popup_title":"Cumbernauld eSports Centre for Competitive Walking Simulators by Alexander MacKinnon","popup_info":"Funded by the Lambent Institute, the 2021 redevelopment of the Cumbernauld Shopping Centre into the new CeCCWS has transformed the centre into both the UK's largest esports facility and cultural institution.

His work is focussed on symbiosis and time in multi-species systems. In his practice he uses ad-hoc mixtures of theory, fiction and art to explore technological ecosystems, following stories of biochemical innovation across deep time, plants terraforming their environments, bacterial warfare and internet extinction events.

His artistic practice explores the relationship between humans and networked technological frameworks through 'Internet Archeology', and processes of automated and organic discovery of elements and their relationships, as well as the development unconventional tools and interfaces between humans and the digital domain. In collaboration with other artists and designers, he creates web and physically based spaces and experiences as part of self-directed and comissioned projects, in addition to helping run the type platform and foundry 'Gruppo Due' as a founding member.\nWebsite: jonasg.me\nInstagram: jonas.gruenwald","id":"aHR0cHM6Ly9wYXJhLW5ldC5zcGFjZS9zcGFjZXMvc3RvbmUtZ2FyZGVuLw==","url":"https:\/\/para-net.space\/spaces\/stone-garden\/","info_url":"http:\/\/0.0.0.0\/wrong\/invites\/para-net?id=aHR0cHM6Ly9wYXJhLW5ldC5zcGFjZS9zcGFjZXMvc3RvbmUtZ2FyZGVuLw==","fullscreen":"false","width":"900","height":"900","position":"mid-center"},{"popup_title":"A Vital Mess by Samuel Turner","popup_info":"Stemming from a reply to \u2018realities\u2019 provided by guest respondent to the residency artist Alice Yuan Zhang, the digital realm is inhabited by a small collection of memorial ghosts. \u2018A Vital Mess\u2019 is a sketch of reminiscences scattered about a digital oneiric non-space and embodied by the technologies which inhabited them.\n\nBio:\nWebsite: samuelantonioturner.com\nInstagram: @turner_png\nTwitter: @turner_png","id":"aHR0cHM6Ly9wYXJhLW5ldC5zcGFjZS8=","url":"https:\/\/para-net.space\/","info_url":"http:\/\/0.0.0.0\/wrong\/invites\/para-net?id=aHR0cHM6Ly9wYXJhLW5ldC5zcGFjZS8=","fullscreen":"true","width":"","height":"","position":""},{"popup_title":"Szonja","popup_info":"Bio:\nSzonja is an interdisciplinary artist existing on the borders of perceived realities.
